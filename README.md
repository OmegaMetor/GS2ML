# GS2ML
 GameMaker Studio 2 Mod Loader  
 (Based on Cgytrus's GMML, made because GMML is broken on newer GameMaker versions due to a change in how the exe is compiled.)  

# Documentation:
While documentation is a work in progress, it should have enough info here to get you started.

# Based on:
https://github.com/cgytrus/gmml  
which is based on  
https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool  

# To do list:
-Finish documentation  
-(MAYBE) find a way to do C# interop without having to hook into the exe and break every time the runtime updates like GMML did. Not sure if this is even possible, lmao.
